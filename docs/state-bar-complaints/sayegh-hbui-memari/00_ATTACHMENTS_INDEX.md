## CRITICAL CLARIFICATION: SOURCE OF FL-150 ERROR

**IMPORTANT:** The $5,500 figure originated from an earlier TRO filing on September 9, 2025, filed by Eric Brakebill-Jones (domestic violence advocate) during emergency TRO proceedings. Eric erroneously attributed $5,500 as "income" based on the average monthly financial support/loans he was providing Nuha after the January 2025 Eaton fires destroyed her home.

**Key Facts:**
- Eric has provided over $50,000 in loans/support since January 2025 fires
- $5,500 was the approximate monthly average of these emergency loans
- These loans are NOT income - they are temporary financial assistance
- Nuha has ZERO employment income
- Eric filed the September TRO as a lay advocate, not an attorney

**H Bui Law Firm's Responsibility:**
Sara Memari and H Bui Law Firm were hired as professional counsel on November 4, 2025. Their duty was to:
1. Review and correct any errors from prior pro se/lay advocate filings
2. Ensure accurate financial declarations before the November 19 hearing
3. Clarify that loans ≠ income for support calculations

**The Malpractice:**
Despite being professional counsel for 15 days before the hearing, Sara Memari:
- Failed to identify and correct the September error
- Perpetuated the false $5,500 income figure in November FL-150
- Ignored Nuha's November 18 warning that income was $0
- Filed the incorrect FL-150 on November 18 at 5:19 PM (day before hearing)
- Result: Court calculated support based on phantom income

## UPDATED STATEMENT LANGUAGE

**Suggested Addition to Complaint:**

"I acknowledge that the $5,500 income figure originated from a September 9, 2025 TRO filing prepared by my domestic violence advocate, Eric Brakebill-Jones, who is not an attorney. Eric mistakenly attributed the $5,500 to represent the average monthly financial support he has provided me and my children since we lost our home in the January 2025 Eaton fires. These funds are loans and emergency assistance, not employment income.

However, when I retained H Bui Law Firm on November 4, 2025, I expected professional counsel to review prior filings, identify errors, and ensure accuracy. I explicitly told Ms. Memari multiple times that my employment income was zero and that I was surviving on EBT food assistance. On November 18, 2025—the day before the hearing—I sent Ms. Memari an email stating 'I'm on food stamps' and requesting corrections to the I&E.

Despite having 15 days to prepare, and despite my explicit warnings, Ms. Memari filed an FL-150 on November 18 at 5:19 PM that perpetuated the false $5,500 income figure. A competent attorney would have: (1) distinguished loans from income, (2) corrected the error before filing, and (3) ensured the court had accurate information for support calculations. Ms. Memari did none of these things."
