## KEY CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL)

**FL-150 Error Context:**
The $5,500 income figure originated from Eric Brakebill-Jones' September 9, 2025 TRO filing (he is a lay advocate, not an attorney). He mistakenly attributed his $50,000+ in emergency loans/support as "income."

**Attorney's Duty:**
H Bui Law Firm was hired November 4, 2025 as professional counsel. They had 15 days to:
- Review prior filings
- Identify and correct the loans vs. income error
- File accurate FL-150

**The Malpractice:**
Despite Nuha explicitly stating she had $0 income and was on food stamps, Sara Memari perpetuated the false $5,500 figure in the November 18 FL-150, causing the court to calculate support incorrectly.
