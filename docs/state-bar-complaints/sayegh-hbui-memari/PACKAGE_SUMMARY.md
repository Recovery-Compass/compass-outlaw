## EVIDENCE STRENGTH: DEVASTATING

### Three Independent Documentary Chains

**Chain 1: FL-150 Income Error**
- September 9 TRO filing: $5,500 (Eric's emergency loans, not income)
- November 4: Professional counsel hired, 15 days to review/correct
- November 18, 4:30 PM: Nuha warns "I'm on food stamps" (income = $0)
- November 18, 5:19 PM: Sara files FL-150 with same $5,500 error
- November 19: Court calculates support using false income
- **Result:** Objectively false sworn financial declaration

**Chain 2: Late Login / Chatsworth Conflict**
- November 17 (2 days before): Sara discloses Chatsworth conflict, recommends remote
- November 18, 8:02 AM: Sara emails "I'm in court this morning in Chatsworth"
- November 19, 8:30 AM: Nuha's hearing scheduled to begin
- November 19, 8:39 AM: Login instructions sent (9 minutes LATE)
- November 19, 8:47 AM: Sara emails "finish my hearing in Chatsworth first"
- **Result:** Client unable to participate; attorney prioritized other case

**Chain 3: Abandonment**
- November 19: Failed hearing due to attorney errors
- November 21: Email sent by Eric (not Nuha) criticizing performance
- November 21: Nuha immediately clarifies email was unauthorized
- November 22, 2:22 AM: Hannah Bui terminates representation anyway
- **Result:** Client abandoned during crisis, errors uncorrected
