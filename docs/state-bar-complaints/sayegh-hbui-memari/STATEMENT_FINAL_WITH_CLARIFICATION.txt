STATEMENT OF COMPLAINT - FINAL VERSION
(Use for both Hannah Bui and Sara Memari complaints)

I hired H Bui Law Firm on November 4, 2025, to represent me in my divorce and domestic violence restraining order case, Sayegh v. Sayegh (Case No. 25PDFL01441), in Los Angeles Superior Court, Pasadena. A retainer of $7,500 was paid on my behalf by Eric Brakebill-Jones, my domestic violence advocate. The handling attorney was Sara Memari, an associate, under the supervision of Hannah Bui, a Certified Family Law Specialist.

I hired the firm to obtain child custody with supervised visitation for my two minor children due to safety concerns involving their father, and to secure spousal and child support. I made clear to Ms. Memari that my income was zero—I was unemployed, homeless, and surviving on EBT food assistance following the January 2025 Eaton fires that destroyed my home.

Failure #1: Material Error in Financial Filing. The firm filed an Income and Expense Declaration (FL-150) on my behalf on November 18, 2025, that listed my monthly income as approximately $5,500. This was false. My actual employment income was $0.

I acknowledge that the $5,500 figure originated from a September 9, 2025 TRO filing prepared by Eric Brakebill-Jones during emergency TRO proceedings. Eric mistakenly attributed this amount to represent the average monthly financial support he has provided me and my children since we lost our home in the fires. He has loaned over $50,000 for our survival. These are loans and emergency assistance, not employment income.

When I retained H Bui Law Firm as professional counsel on November 4, 2025, I expected them to review prior filings, identify errors, and ensure accuracy. I explicitly told Ms. Memari multiple times that my employment income was zero and that I was on food stamps. On November 18, 2025—the day before the hearing—I emailed Ms. Memari stating "I'm on food stamps, $11,000 behind in rent, no heat for my kids" and requested corrections.

Despite having 15 days to prepare and despite my explicit warnings, Ms. Memari filed an FL-150 on November 18 at 5:19 PM that perpetuated the false $5,500 income figure. A competent attorney would have distinguished loans from income, corrected the error before filing, and ensured the court had accurate information. The court relied on this false income figure to calculate temporary support, resulting in an order significantly lower than guideline support.

Failure #2: Late Transmission of Remote Hearing Login. My hearing was scheduled for 8:30 AM on November 19, 2025. The firm did not send me the LA Court Connect login instructions until 8:39 AM—nine minutes after the hearing had already begun. The email from Valerie Arebalo (valerie@hbuilaw.com), with Sara Memari copied, contained instructions to log in via LA Court Connect. Because the login link arrived after the hearing started, I was unable to access the remote portal on time. This directly contributed to my inability to participate in my own hearing.

Failure #3: Failure to Advise on Remote Testimony Restrictions. Ms. Memari also failed to advise me that appearing remotely for a contested evidentiary hearing, without prior court authorization, would bar me from testifying live. Because I was not warned, and because the login link arrived late, I was effectively silenced during the most critical hearing of my case. Ms. Memari herself appeared remotely and was reportedly late due to a scheduling conflict.

Failure #4: Failure to Present Critical Safety Evidence. Prior to the hearing, Eric Brakebill-Jones provided the firm with a comprehensive evidentiary dossier containing over 600 files documenting abuse and child safety concerns—including a specific incident where my 13-year-old daughter was allegedly offered drugs by her father. Despite assurances that Ms. Memari would present this evidence, it was not effectively presented. My children remain without supervised visitation protections.

Failure #5: Abandonment. Less than 48 hours after the hearing, on November 22, 2025 at 2:22 AM, H Bui Law Firm terminated my representation by email, citing a "breakdown in the attorney-client relationship" based on an email sent from my account. That email was sent by Eric Brakebill-Jones without my authorization in frustration over the hearing failures. I immediately clarified this to Ms. Bui. Despite this clarification, Ms. Bui refused to reinstate representation, stating: "My office will NOT be doing so." She retained approximately $4,530 of the original retainer.

I was abandoned in the middle of a custody and financial crisis, forced to represent myself while my children's safety remains unresolved and my support order is based on false income information.

Failure #6: Conflict of Interest - Chatsworth Scheduling. During our November 17, 2025 consultation, Ms. Memari disclosed she already had an in-person hearing scheduled in Chatsworth that conflicted with my November 19 hearing in Pasadena. She steered me toward remote appearance to accommodate her schedule. On November 18, she emailed "I'm in court this morning in Chatsworth." On November 19 at 8:47 AM, she emailed "The Court is going to call us closer to 10am, so I can finish my hearing in Chatsworth first." My hearing was at 8:30 AM. Ms. Memari prioritized her Chatsworth case over my contested custody and DVRO matter, contributing to her late appearance and my inability to effectively participate.

Harm: I am bound by a support order calculated on phantom income I do not have. My children lack supervised visitation protections. I could not access my own hearing on time because my attorneys sent login instructions after the hearing began. I was denied the opportunity to testify because my attorney failed to advise me of remote testimony restrictions. I must now navigate pro per to undo the damage while homeless and on food stamps.

I believe this conduct may violate Rule 1.1 (Competence), Rule 1.3 (Diligence), Rule 1.4 (Communication), Rule 1.7 (Conflict of Interest), and Rule 1.16 (Termination). I am pursuing fee arbitration separately and can provide the retainer agreement, incorrect FL-150, the late login email, Chatsworth scheduling emails, minute order, and all supporting documentation upon request.
