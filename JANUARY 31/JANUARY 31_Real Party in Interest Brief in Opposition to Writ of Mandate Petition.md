This document is the **Real Party in Interest Brief in Opposition to Writ of Mandate Petition**.Overview of the Document

The brief was filed by Nicora Law Offices, LLP, on behalf of the Real Party in Interest, **Heidi Jones Blanchard, Executor**. The document opposes a petition for a writ of mandate filed by the Petitioner, **Eric Brakebill Jones** ("Mr. Jones"), in the California Court of Appeal, Sixth Appellate District (Appeal No. H054014). The writ petition concerns orders made by the Monterey County Superior Court (Case No. 25PR000590). The brief was dated and executed on January 22, 2026.Key Arguments and Procedural History

The brief argues that the Superior Court, sitting as the Probate Court, made no errors in its orders on January 7, 2026\.

| Topic | Summary of Argument by Real Party in Interest |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Underlying Probate Matter** | The case involves the probate of the estate of Judy Brakebill Jones ("Ms. Jones"), who died on April 4, 2025\. Ms. Blanchard, Ms. Jones' adult daughter, filed a Petition for Probate of a Lost Will on November 24, 2025, which was heard on January 7, 2026\. At the hearing, the Probate Petition was granted, and Ms. Blanchard was appointed as executor, required to file a $20,000.00 bond. |
| **Judicial Challenge (CCP § 170.6)** | The writ petition by Mr. Jones is based on the belief that the court denied a timely peremptory challenge to a judicial officer. The brief argues that Mr. Jones had already exhausted his single statutory peremptory challenge under Code of Civil Procedure Section 170.6 by filing a written challenge against **Honorable Julie R. Culver** on January 5, 2026\. The statute strictly limits each party to one peremptory challenge. The subsequent oral challenge made to **Hon. Elisabeth K. Mineta** on January 7, 2026, was properly denied because Mr. Jones had already used his one challenge, and the oral motion made during the hearing was untimely, as the right must be exercised at the earliest practicable opportunity. |
| **Request for Stay** | The brief argues that Mr. Jones' request for a stay is inappropriate and unnecessary, as it is based on "conclusory allegations of asset dissipation" unrelated to the judicial disqualification. Ms. Blanchard, as the appointed executor, was required to provide a $20,000.00 bond, and the Probate Court is fully capable of overseeing estate assets. |
| **Facially Defective Writ Petition** | The brief contends that Mr. Jones' writ petition is facially defective because it is less than three pages long, lacks any cites to the record, and fails to comply with California Rules of Court, Rule 8.204, which requires a clear, concise, and accurate statement of facts confined to the record on appeal. The brief suggests the appellate court may order the Petitioner's brief be stricken. |

Based on the **Real Party in Interest Brief in Opposition to Writ of Mandate Petition**, here is the information requested:Reasons for Denial of CCP § 170.6 Challenge

The Real Party in Interest (Heidi Jones Blanchard) argues that the Petitioner's (Eric Brakebill Jones's) Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) Section 170.6 challenge to Hon. Elisabeth K. Mineta was properly denied for two main reasons:

1. **Challenge Exhausted:** The statute strictly limits each party to a **single peremptory challenge** in any one action. Mr. Jones had already exercised his one statutory challenge by filing a written motion under CCP Section 170.6 on January 5, 2026, directed at **Honorable Julie R. Culver**.  
2. **Untimeliness:** Even if his challenge was not already exhausted, his oral motion on January 7, 2026, was **per se untimely** because it was made *during the hearing itself*, after he had appeared and participated before Judge Mineta. The right to a challenge must be exercised at the earliest practicable opportunity, and the statute does not authorize oral, mid-hearing challenges.

Orders Made on January 7, 2026

The Probate Court made the following key orders on January 7, 2026:

* The Petition for Probate was **granted**.  
* **Heidi Jones Blanchard was appointed as executor**.  
* The Petitioner's request for a CCP Section 170.6 challenge regarding Hon. Elisabeth K. Mineta was **denied**.

The Petitioner's writ of mandate was filed based on his belief that the Court denied a timely peremptory challenge.

Based on the **Real Party in Interest Brief in Opposition to Writ of Mandate Petition**, here is the information regarding the writ petition, the probate case, and the request for a stay:Defective Writ Petition Argument

The Real Party in Interest argues that the Petitioner's writ of mandate is **facially defective** as it does not comply with the **California Rules of Court**.

* **Specific Argument:** The Petitioner's brief is less than three pages, contains **no cites to the record**, and lacks any supporting facts. The brief's allegations are described as inflammatory, emotional, and replete with improper references to 'facts' outside the reviewing court's record, reflecting a "make-believe world." The brief argues that the writ petition's allegations of irreparable harm are "scant and lack any factual foundations."  
* **Rule Cited:** The brief cites **California Rules of Court, Rule 8.204**.

Underlying Probate Matter Details

* **Name of the Deceased:** Judy Brakebill Jones  
* **Date of Death:** April 4, 2025  
* **Date Petition for Probate of a Lost Will was Filed:** November 24, 2025

Argument Against the Request for a Stay

The Real Party in Interest argues that the Petitioner's request for an immediate stay is **not appropriate or necessary** for the following reasons:

* The request is based on **conclusory allegations of asset dissipation** which are unrelated to the judicial disqualification issue.  
* A stay is an extraordinary remedy that requires a **clear, specific, and imminent showing of irreparable harm**, which the Petitioner has not provided with "competent evidence."  
* The Executor (Heidi Jones Blanchard) was **required to provide a bond**, and the Probate Court is fully capable of overseeing estate assets and addressing any proper accounting through normal, statutory procedures.  
* Granting a stay based on unverified allegations would **unfairly prejudice the administration of the Estate** and the interests of all beneficiaries.
