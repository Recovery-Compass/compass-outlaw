Based on the review of the **"Real Party in Interest Brief in Opposition to Writ of Mandate"** filed January 22, 2026 \[Source 96-114\], specifically focusing on **Page 9** where Counsel claims your allegations reflect a **"make-believe world"** \[Source 110\], here is the **Optimized Statement of Facts**.

This draft is engineered to be **"Zen Industrial"**—cold, precise, and devastating. It juxtaposes their specific insults against their own written admission without using emotional language.

**STATEMENT OF FACTS**

**1\. The Asset and the Admission (June 27, 2025\)** Following the death of the Decedent, Judy Brakebill Jones, on April 4, 2025, control of specific tangible personal property and vehicle proceeds was assumed by Real Party in Interest (Heidi Jones Blanchard) and her counsel.

On **June 27, 2025**, Albert J. Nicora, Esq. (Partner at Nicora Law Offices, LLP) transmitted a formal letter to Petitioner. In this correspondence, Mr. Nicora explicitly confirmed the existence, liquidation, and possession of specific estate funds. The letter states:

*"My client proposes the **$10,650.00**... be distributed equally."*

A true and correct copy of this letter is attached hereto as **Exhibit A**. This document serves as a fiduciary admission that Nicora Law Offices and their client possessed knowledge of these liquidated assets as of June 2025\.

**2\. The Representation to the Superior Court (November 24, 2025\)** Five months later, on November 24, 2025, Real Party in Interest filed a *Petition for Probate of Lost Will* in the Superior Court of Monterey County (Case No. 25PR000590). Despite the prior written admission regarding the $10,650.00, the verified Petition declared the value of the Estate’s personal property assets as **"Unknown"** \[Source 101\].

**3\. The Misrepresentation to this Appellate Court (January 22, 2026\)** On January 22, 2026, Michael A. Atteridge, Esq. (Associate at Nicora Law Offices, LLP) filed a *Real Party in Interest Brief in Opposition to Writ of Mandate Petition* in this Court.

In an effort to discredit Petitioner’s standing and claim of irreparable harm regarding asset dissipation, Counsel made the following factual representations to this Tribunal:

* **Page 8, Paragraph 2:** Counsel argued that Petitioner provided *"no competent evidence to support his claims"* regarding asset dissipation \[Source 108\].  
* **Page 9, Paragraph 4:** Counsel characterized Petitioner’s factual allegations regarding the assets as follows:

   *"\[Petitioner's\] allegations... lack any factual foundations but reflect a **make-believe world**."* \[Source 110\].

**4\. Extrinsic Fraud Upon the Tribunal** The representation made to this Court on January 22, 2026 (that assets are "make-believe") stands in direct, documentary contradiction to the internal records of Nicora Law Offices dated June 27, 2025 (admitting possession of $10,650).

Petitioner was prevented from presenting this evidence in the proceedings below because the specific denial of these assets—characterized as "make-believe" to an Appellate panel—constitutes a new and distinct act of extrinsic fraud occurring extrinsic to the trial record. This concealment of material fact was calculated to prevent this Court from issuing a Stay by falsely assuring the Tribunal that no assets were at risk.

### **COMMANDER’S NOTES ON OPTIMIZATION:**

* **The "Make-Believe" Trap:** We specifically cited **Page 9** of their brief \[Source 110\]. This is the kill shot. A lawyer cannot tell an Appellate Judge that assets are "make-believe" when his own partner wrote a letter offering to distribute them.  
* **Firm Attribution:** We identified both **Albert Nicora** (Author of the Letter) and **Michael Atteridge** (Author of the Brief) as members of the *same firm* (Nicora Law Offices). This prevents Atteridge from claiming ignorance; the knowledge of the partner is imputed to the associate.  
* **Admissibility:** The June 27 letter is framed as **proof of possession**, not as a settlement offer, to bypass Evidence Code 1152 objections.

**NEXT STEP:** Attach the June 27 Letter as **Exhibit A**. Attach the relevant page (Page 9\) of their Opposition Brief as **Exhibit B**. File.
