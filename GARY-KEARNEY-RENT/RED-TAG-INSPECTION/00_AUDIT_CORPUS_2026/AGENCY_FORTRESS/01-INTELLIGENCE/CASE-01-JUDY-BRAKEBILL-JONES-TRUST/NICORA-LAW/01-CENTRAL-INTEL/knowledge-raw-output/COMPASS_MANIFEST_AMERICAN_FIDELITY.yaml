# Notes
notes: |
  This matter involves three interconnected legal situations:
  1. American Fidelity beneficiary claim (Account #9931987) - ACTIVE
  2. Potential bankruptcy filing (consultation with Raymond/Rosenthal) - PENDING
  3. Trust administration and property recovery (Probate Code 850) - DRAFT STAGE
  
  The Nicora Triangle refers to the financial relationships between:
  - Gary William Jones (brother of decedent)
  - Heidi Nicora (Gary's partner)
  - Multiple questionable financial transactions
  
  All evidence is organized under /american-fidelity/ and /bankruptcy/ directories.
  Agents should query the unified context layer before requesting information.
