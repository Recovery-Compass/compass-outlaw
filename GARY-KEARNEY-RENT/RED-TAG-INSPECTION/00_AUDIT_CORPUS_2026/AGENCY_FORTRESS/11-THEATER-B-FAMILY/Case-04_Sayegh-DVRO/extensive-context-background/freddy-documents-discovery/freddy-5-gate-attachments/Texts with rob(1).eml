Explanation of Text Messages with =E2=80=9CMachete=E2=80=9D (Rob Gonz=C3=A1=
lez)


From: Fahed =E2=80=9CFreddy=E2=80=9D Sayegh

Subject: Context and intent of July=E2=80=93October text thread regarding t=
he =E2=80=9CDJ
Machete=E2=80=9D name


Bottom line


These were informal, friend-to-friend messages. I was not acting as Rob=E2=
=80=99s
attorney, gave no legal analysis, charged no fee, and did not contact any
third party. Where I floated =E2=80=9C$25,000 and change your name,=E2=80=
=9D it was obvious
hyperbole; Rob immediately replied =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re kidding right?=
=E2=80=9D with laugh
reactions.


Relationship / capacity


   -

   Rob and I are longtime friends in the music scene.
   -

   We have no attorney=E2=80=93client agreement, no fee, and no expectation=
 of
   legal services.
   -

   I never told him I represented him, and he never asked me to represent
   him.


What the texts show (key call-outs)


   1.

   Rob=E2=80=99s initial ask (July 1, 11:39 AM): He tells me someone else i=
s using
   =E2=80=9CMachete,=E2=80=9D says he doesn=E2=80=99t have a U.S. trademark=
, and asks =E2=80=9CWhat can I do?=E2=80=9D
   2.

   My joking line (blue bubble): =E2=80=9CWrite him an apology=E2=80=A6 cha=
nge your name=E2=80=A6
   pay no less than $25,000.=E2=80=9D This is joking hyperbole; it is immed=
iately met
   with =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=99re kidding right?=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cha ha=
=E2=80=9D reactions.
   3.

   Courtesy draft (blue block): I sent a PR-style, respectful outreach
   template (subject line =E2=80=9CRequest to Resolve Name Confusion=E2=80=
=9D). It avoids
   threats or legal demands and aims to de-escalate. Rob says he=E2=80=99s =
=E2=80=9Cok with
   this=E2=80=A6 made some minor edits=E2=80=A6 will only escalate if neces=
sary.=E2=80=9D
   4.

   Self-help direction (July 8, 11:21 AM): I text, =E2=80=9CLooks like you =
might
   want to try to register it yourself NOW,=E2=80=9D meaning he should hand=
le any
   filing himself or with his own counsel.
   5.

   Later chatter (mid=E2=80=93late July): He updates me about confusion wit=
h
   promoters and asks generic questions. I do not provide analysis or conta=
ct
   anyone.
   6.

   Personal tone: The thread also includes friendly logistics and his kids=
=E2=80=99
   birthday invite=E2=80=94underscoring this was a personal conversation, n=
ot
   professional work.


What I did not do


   -

   I did not analyze trademark law, rights, or defenses.
   -

   I did not draft, send, or threaten any cease-and-desist or other legal
   notice.
   -

   I did not negotiate with, or communicate to, any third party (DJ,
   promoter, platform, or lawyer).
   -

   I did not accept or request any payment, nor did I keep time or create
   =E2=80=9Cwork product.=E2=80=9D


How to label the exhibits (helpful for your binder)


   -

   Ex. A (July 1): Rob=E2=80=99s initial gray texts + my blue =E2=80=9C$25k=
/change your
   name=E2=80=9D line =E2=86=92 immediately followed by =E2=80=9CYou=E2=80=
=99re kidding right?=E2=80=9D and laugh
   reactions.
   -

   Ex. B (July 1): My blue courtesy communication template (=E2=80=9CReques=
t to
   Resolve Name Confusion=E2=80=9D)=E2=80=94explicitly non-legal tone.
   -

   Ex. C (July 8): My blue =E2=80=9Cregister it yourself NOW=E2=80=9D text.
   -

   Ex. D (mid=E2=80=93late July): Rob=E2=80=99s follow-ups about confusion;=
 no legal steps
   by me.
   -

   Ex. E (Oct 11): Kids=E2=80=99 birthday invite=E2=80=94personal context.


One-paragraph summary for you to use


=E2=80=9CThese screenshots reflect a casual conversation between friends. M=
r.
Sayegh did not represent Mr. Gonz=C3=A1lez, charged no fee, gave no legal
analysis, and sent no communications to any third party. The
=E2=80=98$25,000/change your name=E2=80=99 line was a joke, as evidenced by=
 the immediate
=E2=80=98You=E2=80=99re kidding right?=E2=80=99 and laugh reactions. The lo=
ng blue message is a
courtesy PR template meant to de-escalate, not a legal demand. Mr. Sayegh
expressly directed Rob to =E2=80=98register it yourself NOW,=E2=80=99 confi=

Rob=E2=80=94not Mr. Sayegh=E2=80=94should handle any filing or seek his own=
 counsel.=E2=80=9D
