Filing receipt for trademark/service mark application, Principal Register
and next steps in the application process
Thank you for submitting your trademark application to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO)! You have started the legal process to federally
register your mark.
This filing receipt confirms that you successfully submitted your
application, which now must be reviewed to see if it qualifies for
registration. Registration is not automatic or guaranteed. Below you will
see your mark, the serial number assigned to your application, and a
description of what happens next in the application process. Carefully
review this information to make sure it is correct and so you know what to
expect. We also highly recommend keeping a copy for your records.
Please pay attention to the section below regarding scams and read the Prot=
ect
against scams section <https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/protect> on our
website. Also, we encourage you to take advantage of the resources we have
linked at the end for first-time applicants, startups, and women
entrepreneurs.
Your mark
MACHETE (standard characters, mark.jpg)
The literal element of the mark consists of MACHETE. The mark consists of
standard characters, without claim to any particular font style, size, or
color.
Your serial number
Your application was assigned serial number 99282397. You must refer to
your serial number in all communications about your application.

<https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/apply/after-you-file> for information on
correcting errors.
What we do next
Now that your application has been submitted, it will eventually be
assigned to an examining attorney. The examining attorney reviews your
application to make sure it meets all of the legal requirements and that
your mark is registrable. To learn more, please visit the Examination of
your application webpage
<https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/examination-application> and
the Trademark
basics webpage <https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics>.
Marks with a design element
If your mark includes a design element, we=E2=80=99ll assign it one or more=
 design
search codes <https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/search/design-search-codes>.
We=E2=80=99ll notify you of these codes within the next several weeks and y=
ou can
suggest that we add or delete a design search code from your file.
Timing
It will take some time before you hear from the examining attorney. Check
out what impacts how long it takes to register
<https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/how-long-does-it-take-register>
your mark and the current average processing times
<https://www.uspto.gov/dashboard/trademarks/application-timeline.html>.
Office actions
If your application does not meet all of the requirements, you=E2=80=99ll r=
eceive a
communication from your examining attorney called an =E2=80=9Coffice action=
.=E2=80=9D This
doesn=E2=80=99t automatically mean your mark isn=E2=80=99t registrable. It =
describes any
issues the examining attorney found in your application. Your reply to an
office action is an opportunity to resolve the issues. You must reply by
the deadline to continue the application process and avoid abandonment of
your application.
If you have questions, see how to respond to office actions
<https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/maintain/responding-office-actions> or
call the assigned examining attorney. The attorney=E2=80=99s contact inform=
ation is

the office action at no cost to you. Please keep in mind that they cannot
provide you with legal advice.
What else you should do
These are things to monitor while your application moves through the
examination process.
Keep your addresses current in USPTO records
If your postal or email address changes, you must update the owner's
address using the electronic filing forms
<https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/apply/correspondence-and-attorneydomestic=
-representative>
on our website. We don=E2=80=99t extend filing deadlines if you don=E2=80=
=99t receive USPTO
mail or email.
Check your application status in our database every three to four months
To be sure that you don't miss an important email from us, and to avoid the
possible abandonment
<https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/apply/reviving-abandoned-application> of
your application, check your application status and review your documents
in our database, Trademark Status and Document Retrieval (TSDR)
<https://tsdr.uspto.gov/>, every three to four months.
TSDR contains your complete application record. It includes every
communication we send you and every action related to your application.
Watch out for scams
Recognizing common signs of a scam can help you avoid costly mistakes.
Scammers pretend to be from the USPTO, often state there=E2=80=99s some sor=
t of
problem with your application, pressure you to act immediately, and tell
you to pay some sort of fee or provide personal information. Some will even
call you and use names, numbers, and locations of real USPTO employees to
try to steal your money or personal information. USPTO employees will never
ask you for your personal or payment information over the phone.
If you receive a notification about paying to publish your trademark in a
directory, avoid doing so. Trademark directory listings aren=E2=80=99t nece=
ssary.
They=E2=80=99re unofficial and not associated with the USPTO.
All official communications will be from the "United States Patent and
Trademark Office" in Alexandria, Virginia, and from emails with the domain =
"
uspto.gov." If you=E2=80=99re unsure about whether a communication is from =
us, call
or email the Trademark Assistance Center
<https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/support-centers/trademark-ass=
istance-center>
or check your records in our database, TSDR <https://tsdr.uspto.gov/>. Any
official communications we send you will be uploaded to your records in
TSDR. Visit protect against scams <https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/protect=
