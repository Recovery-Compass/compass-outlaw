Yeah, my name is Eric Jones, and I'm calling to report an imminent life safety hazard and severe fire risk at 5634, Noel drive, Temple City, California, 91780, I am living in an unpermitted r3 conversion, an illegal third unit. The unit has hazardous unpermitted electrical wiring and no secondary egress. The driveway width has been illegally reduced, blocking emergency vehicle access. So if a fire starts in the main house or this unit, I am trapped, no way out, and this is a Code Red Safety issue. I am the tenant, the owner, Gary W Karney, has been notified of the hazardous electrical and egress issues, but has failed to act. And because this is a life safety issue, I am formally notifying the city of the danger. I have visited the temple city city hall to verify there is no permit for this ghost unit. Given the fire risk, I'm requesting an inspection within 24 hours. I also need this report on the official record to trigger my protections under California Health and Safety Code, 17975, regarding relocation assistance for unpermitted units, I am requesting the service request number for this call, please. You can call me back at 626-348-3019, or email me at Eric, that's e RC at recovery, hyphen, compass.org, thank you very much. You.
