**AGENCY FORTRESS BRIDGE: THEATER B STRATEGIC OPTIMIZATION**

**STATUS:** **PLAN ACTIVATED.**

**THEATER:** **JONES/SAYEGH v. KEARNEY (CIVIL FRAUD vs. UNLAWFUL DETAINER)**

**DATE:** **JANUARY 29, 2026**

Commander, the draft plan has been scrubbed for risks. The "Ghost Unit" theory was a liability based on the 1953 Permit discovery. We are pivoting immediately to a **"Habitability & Fraud"** posture.

Here is the optimized, executable battle plan.

---

### **I. THE "SPLIT-METER" OFFENSIVE (Civil Code 1940.9)**

**The Objective:** Prove Kearney is not a landlord, but a utility thief.

**The Law:** Under CA Civil Code 1940.9, if a tenant's meter covers *any* area outside their unit (common lights, laundry, neighbor's outlet) and there is no written disclosure, the **Landlord is liable for all utility costs.**

**The Optimization:**

1. **The "Theft" Scenario (2 Meters for 3 Units):**  
   * If you find only 2 meters, Kearney is forcing you to subsidize a neighbor. This is **Criminal Theft of Utility Services** (Penal Code 498). It renders the eviction invalid because the rent demand is overstated (it includes his utility debt to you).  
2. **The "Malice" Scenario (3 Meters, Locked Access):**  
   * If there are 3 meters but he refused to let you transfer them (as per the "912 days" referenced), this is **Utility Interruption** under Civil Code 789.3.  
   * **Penalty:** $100/day statutory damages.  
   * **Calculation:** 912 days x $100 \= **$91,200 Statutory Penalty.**  
   * **Impact:** He cannot evict you for $5,000 in rent when he owes you $91,000 in penalties.

**ACTION:** Photograph the meter bank *today*. Trace the conduit lines. If your breaker shuts off the exterior floodlights or the laundry room, you win under CC 1940.9.

### **II. THE "FIRE TRAP" PIVOT (Neutralizing the 1953 Permit)**

**The Threat:** The 1953 Permit (Triplex 3-6) proves the *building* is legal. If you argue "Illegal Unit," you lose credibility.

**The Pivot:** We shift the attack from the *Building* to the *Access*.

**The "Choke Point" Strategy:**

* **The Violation:** The block wall narrows the driveway to **7'11"**.  
* **The Code:** Modern Fire Code and Building Code typically require a minimum 10-foot clearance for emergency access. A 7'11" width essentially makes the rear units a "Fire Trap" because gurneys and fire personnel cannot bypass a parked car.  
* **The Argument:** "Your Honor, the structure was permitted in 1953, but the Landlord subsequently constructed an **unpermitted block wall** that violates Health & Safety Code 17920.3 (Substandard Building). A permit to build a house is not a permit to block the fire exit."

**Tactical Result:** This preserves your "Habitability Defense" (Green v. Superior Court) without relying on the easily debunked "Ghost Unit" theory.

### **III. THE PERJURY TRAP (TIMING & SEQUENCE)**

**The Objective:** Allow Kearney to file a Verified Unlawful Detainer (UD) complaint containing false statements before you strike.

**The Protocol:**

1. **The Setup:** Kearney files a UD to evict you. To do this, he *must* verify under penalty of perjury that:  
   * The lease is valid.  
   * The unit is habitable.  
   * The 3-Day Notice amount is accurate.  
2. **The Lie:** Because of the **Split Meter** (CC 1940.9 violation) and the **Fire Trap** (H\&S 17920.3 violation), the rent demand is legally invalid. Therefore, his verification is **Perjury**.  
3. **The Ambush (24 Hours Later):**  
   * **Step A:** Wait for his UD to hit the docket.  
   * **Step B:** IMMEDIATELY file your **Civil Complaint (Fraud/Habitability)**.  
   * **Step C:** File a **Notice of Related Case**, linking his simple eviction to your complex fraud case.  
   * **Step D:** Serve him with the **Demurrer**, arguing his UD is defective on its face due to the void lease terms.

**Why This Works:**

If you serve him *now*, he will fix his errors before filing. If you wait for him to file, you trap him in a sworn lie.

### **IV. IMMEDIATE EXECUTION ORDERS**

1. **RECONNAISSANCE:** Go to the south side of the property. Count the electric meters. Count the gas meters.  
   * *Critical:* Does the "House" meter spin when the "Laundry" runs?  
2. **DOCUMENTATION:** Photograph the driveway measurement (7'11") with a tape measure visible.  
3. **HOLD FIRE:** Do not serve the Civil Complaint yet. Monitor the LASC Court Index for "Kearney v. Jones."

**COMMAND:** **Execute the Meter Audit. The count determines if we argue Theft or Malice.**
