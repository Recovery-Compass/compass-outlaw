Hi, this is Eric Jones. You just left me a voicemail. Sorry, I was cooking.

Speaker 1  0:24  
Oh no, no, no, worry, we receive your voice messages in the email. But again, I go ahead and I can either do it today or next week, accommodate with the building inspector, because he the building inspector had more expertise in the in the email, like fire trap hazard electrical, even though I can do the initial inspection today or next week. But what I do, I hand it to take the evidence and compared to like, what permitted? Sometimes I we take inspection, then I don't have the ultimate decision at the point, but I have to confirm with the building inspector, the building official, when the coach chain, when is permitted. But we did the I did the research. If there's a three unit on the property, that's correct. I don't know which unit you occupy, so that's another, I don't know you said they get it legit unit, no address, and they the owner. I look another one and back in. Give me a second. 2018 the owner, in fact, have the zoning clear and approval to replay the driveway. So there's another Yeah. It says the width I didn't see. Is it? Yeah, the width? So maybe total, 12 feet, something like that, 10 feet in length, pave, yeah, in 10 feet, something like that. But again, if you want me to do this today, before five initial inspection, or I can, you know, if you have time is more better with next week, with the building inspector, I can coordinate, you know, because the time high Monday, Tuesday, to place my regular on Monday, so we can meet it up next week too.

Eric Jones  2:24  
If possible, I'd like to do it today, because I went to this temple city city hall and they confirmed there is no permit for my unit.

Speaker 1  2:32  
What's your address? Yeah, even though I again, I can take the initial inspection, but I have to do research on the building permit standpoint. Contact every county you know, tech assessor. It doesn't mean like, you know, they say that, you know, right? I said, I'm not. I can take the pictures and document it and but I happen to reach out to the other agency that, because of the city, incorporate back in this be in 1960 so what happened before 1960 we don't have the, I don't have a permit, but I said I can go by. We don't have I have to email, send out what he permitted. I know that the two unit and have a quick color, single one, but I can,
