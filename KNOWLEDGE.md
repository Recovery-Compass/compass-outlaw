## I. THE UNWRITTEN TEXT: LEVERAGE-FIRST ASYMMETRIC WARFARE

This document codifies the strategic doctrine shift that transforms Compass Outlaw from a "legal filing assistant" into a **force multiplier for asymmetric legal warfare**.

### Core Doctrine

**Leverage-First:** Never engage in symmetric warfare (matching resources against resources). Instead, identify and exploit asymmetric leverage points where minimal input yields maximum strategic output.

### Force Multipliers

| Principle | Definition | Application |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Seismic Crystal Lava (SCL)** | Detect fault lines (Seismic), solidify evidence (Crystal), flow into vulnerabilities (Lava) | Kolodji UPL = fault line; Declaration = crystal; State Bar Complaint = lava |
| **Trim Tab** | The small rudder that moves the big rudder | One unanswered email (Oct 26) invalidates entire $16k fee claim |
| **5-Bird** | Every action must achieve 5+ strategic victories | Complaint = Offense + Recovery + Logistics + Tactical + Deterrence |

## II. ARCHITECT vs EXECUTOR PROTOCOL

### Division of Labor

| Role | Agent | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| **ARCHITECT** | Gemini CLI / Google AI Studio | Strategy, Legal Drafting, PFV Audits, App Architecture |
| **EXECUTOR** | Claude Code CLI | Mining, Engineering, API Config, File Operations |
| **INTERFACE** | Compass Outlaw App | User-facing workflow, Document rendering, Portal navigation |
| **KNOWLEDGE** | NotebookLM | Universal memory, Cross-session recall, Doctrine storage |

### Anti-Pattern: Context Collapse
Never ask the Architect to do Executor tasks (mining) or vice versa (drafting). This causes "Context Collapse" - where an agent attempts tasks outside its optimized domain, resulting in degraded performance.
