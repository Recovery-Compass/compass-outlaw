## STRATEGIC DOCTRINE CHEAT SHEET

### SCL (Seismic Crystal Lava)
```
1. SEISMIC  → Find the fault line (weakness)
2. CRYSTAL  → Solidify evidence into admissible form
3. LAVA     → Flow into the crack and expand
```

**Example:** UPL is the fault line → Eric Jones Declaration is crystal → State Bar Complaint is lava

### Trim Tab
```
Small rudder → Big ship movement
```

**Example:** One unanswered Oct 26 email invalidates entire $16,000 fee claim

### 5-Bird
```
Every action must achieve 5+ victories:
✓ Offense    (damage adversary)
✓ Recovery   (reclaim assets)
✓ Logistics  (position for next move)
✓ Tactical   (immediate advantage)
✓ Deterrence (prevent future attacks)
```
